Morri!\"</p> <p>Como J. sentou-se na primeira fileira, a camiseta chamou a atenção do professor P., que perdera há aproximadamente dois anos o seu filho mais novo, vítima de uma sobredose de cocaína. Indignado, o professor exigiu a retirada do aluno da sala de aula. Este se dirigiu à diretoria de sua faculdade para reclamar. Chegando lá, levou uma suspensão de 5 (cinco) dias. A suspensão foi fundamentada no art. 147 do Regulamento Interno da Universidade (RIUn). O referido art. 147 do RIUn prescrevia pena de suspensão de 5 a 15 dias para alunos que estimulassem o desrespeito às leis e ao Estado democrático de direito. J. procurou seu amigo O., na época recém-formado em direito, pedindo-lhe ajuda. Antes de entrar em juízo, O. quer analisar a situação jurídico-constitucional do seu caso para saber se tem chances de êxito. Para tanto, O. precisa de um parecer técnico-jurídico-constitucional, no qual restaria claro se houve violação da Constituição da República Federativa do Brasil, mais especificamente de um direito fundamental de J. </p> <p><b>FONTE</b> (com adaptações): DIMOULIS, Dimitri; MARTINS, Leonardo. <b>Teoria geral dos direitos fundamentais</b>. 4.ed.

(2003, p. 132), <i><b>falácias</b></i> resultam de: 1) razões ausentes; 2) razões irrelevantes; 3) razões defeituosas; 4) suposições não garantidas; e 5) de ambiguidades.</p><p><br>Especificamente, 1) quando nenhuma evidência concreta é apresentada em prol da conclusão, há a configuração do pseudoargumento, isto é, de uma falácia por falta de razões; 2) quando se apresenta o tipo errado de provas ou dados que não pertencem nem têm relação com a conclusão que se quer, gera-se uma falácia por razões irrelevantes; 3) na falácia por razões falhas, geralmente, se apresentam evidências adequadas, mas insuficientes, à pretensão/conclusão; 4) falácias que resultam de garantias infundadas envolvem a presunção de que se pode ir dos motivos para a conclusão quando, realmente, não se pode. Neste tipo de falácia, geralmente, supõe-se que existe um consenso generalizado sobre a aplicabilidade da garantia, quando, na verdade, não há; 5) O último tipo de falácias resulta de ambiguidades. Isto é, algum termo no argumento pode ser interpretado de mais de uma maneira. Nesta quinta classe de falácias, o problema está no significado de termos ou afirmações dentro do argumento ao invés de problemas estruturais nas inferências do argumento, como ocorrem nos quatro primeiros tipos.</p><hr><p>Noutra perspectiva, pode-se somar às características já expostas quatro condições individualmente necessárias e conjuntamente suficientes, para que determinado raciocínio atinja uma conclusão correta, elencadas por David Hitchcock em uma análise aprofundada ao modelo de argumento de Toulmin:<br></p><p><br></p><p><i>Deve ser justificada a aceitação das razões definitivas, a quais baseiam o raciocínio; <br></i><i>As razões devem incluir todas as informações relevantes e justificadas obtidas praticamente; <br></i><i>A conclusão deve seguir em virtude de uma garantia justificada; <br></i><i>Se a garantia não é universal, deve-se assumir que, no caso concreto, não há anuladores que excluem a aplicação da garantia. </i><br>(2006, p. 204-205, tradução nossa)</p><p><br></p><p>Ainda com base no estudo de Hitchcock (2006), compete mencionar que</p><p><br></p><p><i>Naturalmente, inexiste teste definitivo ou regra de ouro para se chegar a uma conclusão correta. Não podemos escrever a conclusão em um pedaço de papel, mergulhá-lo em um líquido, e determinar a partir da cor do papel se a conclusão é correta ou incorreta. Nós não somos visionários infalíveis, mas seres humanos, trabalhando com informações incompletas, inferiores a uma qualidade perfeita. Em vez de exatidão ou a verdade, temos que nos contentar com a melhor alternativa [...]. É por essa razão que, em alguns casos ou na maioria das vezes, nós qualificamos as nossas conclusões com palavras como “provavelmente” ou “possivelmente”, e em função disto nós reconhecemos potenciais refutações</i> (p. 204, tradução nossa).<br> </p>\n"]]
